# CSE332-18_BIT_MIPS_ARCHITECTURE
CSE332-COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE PROJECT. The following project is a 18 bit MIPS architecture made with the help of  logism 2.7.1 version . You can download logism from this website https://sourceforge.net/projects/circuit/ or you can just search for it in the internet

This project was done with the help of my group mate SadmanSkb55 on both the design and code part

the contents of "demo code" file is basically a part we used to test whether our code in the assembler worked accordingly to our design
